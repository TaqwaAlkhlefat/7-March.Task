        <p class="once"> Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old I started to go into the street to get a ball that had rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and knocked me backwords onto the sidewalk I was mad until Isow the car go by where I would have been Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was! </p>
